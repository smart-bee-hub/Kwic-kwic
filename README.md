# Kwic

Kwic is a tool that means you never have to find your API keys again. Just save it once under a name, and retrieve it whenever you need. Of course, this doesn't have to be for API keys, use it to store whatever text you need.<br>

## How To Use

Kwic was made quite simple. It only has a few commands you need:

- Register a key `kwic -n my-api-key thisismyapikey`

- Copy a key to clipboard `kwic -c my-api-key`

- Rename a key `kwic -r my-api-key new-name`

- List all saved keys `kwic ls`

    This will return something that looks like this:

    ```
    my-api-key:thisismyapikey
    github-token:ghp_whatevermytokenis
    stackpassword:mystackoverflowpassword
    ```

    The colon simply acts as a separator between the name you set, and the value.

- Delete a key `kwic rm my-api-key`

## Disclaimer

I've only been coding C for a month now, and this is the first project I've built in it. I know the code probably won't be up to your standards, so please feel free to make a pull request and help me out. This is the first time I've worked with a low level language due to being in secondary school.

Feel free to expand this and make any pull requests to help improve.

## Dependencies

Kwic only work on **Linux systems** with **Wayland**.
